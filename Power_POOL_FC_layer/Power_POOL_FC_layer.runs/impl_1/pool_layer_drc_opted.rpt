UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
LUT as Logic over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more LUT as Logic cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 349863 of such cell types but only 218600 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device. Please set tcl parameter "drc.disableLUTOverUtilError" to 1 to change this error to warning.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT

Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
3903 out of 3903 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: count_x[4:0], count_y[4:0], pool_0_00[68:0], pool_0_01[68:0], pool_0_10[68:0], pool_0_11[68:0], pool_1_00[68:0], pool_1_01[68:0], pool_1_10[68:0], pool_1_11[68:0], pool_2_00[68:0], pool_2_01[68:0], pool_2_10[68:0], pool_2_11[68:0], pool_3_00[68:0] (the first 15 of 55 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
3903 out of 3903 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: count_x[4:0], count_y[4:0], pool_0_00[68:0], pool_0_01[68:0], pool_0_10[68:0], pool_0_11[68:0], pool_1_00[68:0], pool_1_01[68:0], pool_1_10[68:0], pool_1_11[68:0], pool_2_00[68:0], pool_2_01[68:0], pool_2_10[68:0], pool_2_11[68:0], pool_3_00[68:0] (the first 15 of 55 listed).

DSP prob_41__2 multiplier stage prob_41__2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

IOCNT-1#1 Warning
Number of IOs  
The design contains 3903 unplaced I/O ports while the target device, xc7z045ffg900-2, has 362 remaining available user I/O pins. This DRC assumes that all ports which do not drive MGT pins should be placed on user I/O pins. To correct this issue:
1. Ensure you are targeting the correct device and package. Select a larger device or different package if necessary.
2. Check the top-level ports of the design to ensure the correct number of ports are specified.
3. Consider design changes to reduce the number of user I/O pins needed.
